.. _salt-api:

Using the Salt REST API
=======================

To be able to use the Salt HTTP API, similarly to :ref:`events`, you will 
need to have the Salt Master running, and, of course, also the Salt API 
service.

As the core functionality if based on the :ref:`proxy-runner`, check out first 
the notes from :ref:`runner` to understand how to have the ``proxy`` Runner 
available on your Master.

The Salt API configuration is unchanged from the usual approaches: see 
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html 
how to configure and https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/cli/salt-api.html 
how to start up the salt-api process.

Suppose we have the following configuration:

``/etc/salt/master``

.. code-block:: yaml

  rest_cherrypy:
    port: 8080
    ssl_crt: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
    ssl_key: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.key

.. hint::

    Consider looking at the :ref:`example-salt-api` and :ref:`example-salt-sapi`
    examples for end-to-end examples on configuring the Salt API or
    ``salt-sapi``, however the official Salt documentation should always be
    used as the reference.

Starting with salt-sproxy 2020.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning with the *salt-sproxy* release 2020.2.0, the usage has been 
simplified compared to previous versions, and a new API client has been added, 
named ``sproxy``, together with its counter-part ``sproxy_async`` for 
asynchronous requests.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`salt-sapi`

In order to do so, instead of starting the usual ``salt-api`` process, you'd 
need to start a separate application named ``salt-sapi`` which is shipped 
together with *salt-sproxy*. Everything stay the exact same as usually, the 
only difference being the special ``sproxy`` and ``sproxy_async`` clients for 
simplified usage.

.. important::

    Beginning with Salt release 3006, in order to have enable the ``sproxy`` 
    and ``sproxy_async`` clients, you need to explicitly list them under the 
    ``netapi_enable_clients`` configuration option, otherwise, Salt will reject 
    any API requests to either of these.
    See 
    https://docs.saltproject.io/en/master/topics/netapi/netapi-enable-clients.html 
    for more details.

    Example: ``/etc/salt/master``

    .. code-block:: yaml

        netapi_enable_clients:
          - local
          - local_async
          - sproxy
          - sproxy_async

A major advantage of using the ``sproxy`` / ``sproxy_async`` clients is that 
the usage is very similar to the ``local`` / ``local_async`` clients (see 
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#usage), 
the arguments you'd need to being in-line with the ones from `LocalClient 
<https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/clients/index.html#salt.client.LocalClient.cmd>`__: 
``tgt`` (target expression) and ``fun`` (the name of the Salt function to 
execute) as mandatory arguments, plus a number of optional arguments documented 
at https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runners/proxy.html#_runners.proxy.execute.
See an usage example below.

.. hint::

    If you are already using Salt API, and would like to make use of the 
    ``sproxy`` / ``sproxy_async`` client(s), you may want to use the
    ``salt-sapi`` instead of the ``salt-api`` program, and you'll be able to use
    the Salt API as always, armed with the *salt-sproxy* clients as well.

.. tip::

    As mentioned in 
    https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#best-practices,

        Running asynchronous jobs results in being able to process [...] 17x
        more commands per second (as the ``sproxy_async`` requests make use of 
        the ``RunnerClient`` interface).

    Running with ``sproxy_async`` will return you a JID with you can then later
    use to gather the job returns:

         Job returns can be fetched from Salt's job cache via the
         ``/jobs/<jid>`` endpoint, or they can be collected into a data store
         using Salt's Returner system.

        See 
        https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#jobs 
        for further details.

After starting the ``salt-sapi`` process, you should get the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -i localhost:8080
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Server: CherryPy/18.3.0
    Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2020 23:13:28 GMT
    Allow: GET, HEAD, POST
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: GET, POST
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    Content-Length: 172

    {"return": "Welcome", "clients": ["local", "local_async", "local_batch", "local_subset", "runner", "runner_async", "sproxy", "sproxy_async", "ssh", "wheel", "wheel_async"]}

That means the *salt-sproxy* Salt API is ready to receive requests.

Usage examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -sS localhost:8080/run -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
        -d eauth='pam' \
        -d username='mircea' \
        -d password='pass' \
        -d client='sproxy' \
        -d tgt='minion1' \
        -d fun='test.ping'
   return:
   - minion1: true

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -sS localhost:8080/run -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        -d eauth='pam' \
        -d username='mircea' \
        -d password='pass' \
        -d client='sproxy_async' \
        -d tgt='minion\d' \
        -d tgt_type='pcre' \
        -d fun='test.ping' \
    {"return": [{"tag": "salt/run/20200103001109995573", "jid": "20200103001109995573"}]}

Before salt-sproxy 2020.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After starting the ``salt-api`` process, we should get the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -i localhost:8080
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Server: CherryPy/18.1.1
    Date: Wed, 05 Jun 2019 07:58:32 GMT
    Allow: GET, HEAD, POST
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: GET, POST
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    Content-Length: 146

    {"return": "Welcome", "clients": ["local", "local_async", "local_batch", "local_subset", "runner", "runner_async", "ssh", "wheel", "wheel_async"]}

That means the Salt API is ready to receive requests.

To invoke a command on a (network) device managed through Salt, you can use the
``proxy`` Runner to invoke commands on, e.g.,

.. code-block:: bash

  $ curl -sS localhost:8080/run -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
    -d eauth='pam' \
    -d username='mircea' \
    -d password='pass' \
    -d client='runner' \
    -d fun='proxy.execute' \
    -d tgt='minion1' \
    -d function='test.ping' \
    -d sync=True
  return:
  - minion1: true

Note that the execution is at the ``/run`` endpoint, with the following 
details:

- ``username``, ``password``, ``eauth`` as configured in the ``external_auth``. 
  See https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/eauth/index.html for more 
  details and how to configure external authentication.
- ``client`` is *runner*, as we're going to use the ``proxy`` Runner.
- ``fun`` is the name of the Runner function, in this case 
  :func:`_runners.proxy.execute`.
- ``tgt`` is the Minion ID / device name to target.
- ``function`` is the Salt function to execute on the targeted device(s).
- ``sync`` is set as ``True`` as the execution must be synchronous because we're
  waiting for the output to be returned back over the API. Otherwise, if we only
  need to invoke the function without expecting an output, we don't need to pass
  this argument.

This HTTP request is the equivalent of CLI from the example :ref:`example-101`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ salt-sproxy minion1 test.ping

It works in the same way when execution function on actual devices, for 
instance when gathering the ARP table from a Juniper router (the equivalent 
of the ``salt-sproxy juniper-router net.arp`` CLI from the example 
:ref:`example-napalm`):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ curl -sS localhost:8080/run -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
    -d eauth='pam' \
    -d username='mircea' \
    -d password='pass' \
    -d client='runner' \
    -d fun='proxy.execute' \
    -d tgt='juniper-router' \
    -d function='net.arp' \
    -d sync=True
  return:
  - juniper-router:
      comment: ''
      out:
      - age: 891.0
        interface: fxp0.0
        ip: 10.96.0.1
        mac: 92:99:00:0A:00:00
      - age: 1001.0
        interface: fxp0.0
        ip: 10.96.0.13
        mac: 92:99:00:0A:00:00
      - age: 902.0
        interface: em1.0
        ip: 128.0.0.16
        mac: 02:42:AC:12:00:02
      result: true

Or when updating the configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ curl -sS localhost:8080/run -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
    -d eauth='pam' \
    -d username='mircea' \
    -d password='pass' \
    -d client='runner' \
    -d fun='proxy.execute' \
    -d tgt='juniper-router' \
    -d function='net.load_config' \
    -d text='set system ntp server 10.10.10.1' \
    -d test=True \
    -d sync=True
  return:
  - juniper-router:
      already_configured: false
      comment: Configuration discarded.
      diff: '[edit system]
        +   ntp {
        +       server 10.10.10.1;
        +   }'
      loaded_config: ''
      result: true

  $ curl -sS localhost:8080/run -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
    -d eauth='pam' \
    -d username='mircea' \
    -d password='pass' \
    -d client='runner' \
    -d fun='proxy.execute' \
    -d tgt='juniper-router' \
    -d function='net.load_config' \
    -d text='set system ntp server 10.10.10.1' \
    -d sync=True
  return:
  - juniper-router:
      already_configured: false
      comment: ''
      diff: '[edit system]
        +   ntp {
        +       server 10.10.10.1;
        +   }'
      loaded_config: ''
      result: true


You can follow the same methodology with any other Salt function (including
States) that you might want to execute against a device, without having a
(Proxy) Minion running.
