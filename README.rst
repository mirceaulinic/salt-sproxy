`Salt <https://github.com/saltstack/salt>`__ plugin to automate the management
and configuration of network devices at scale, without running (Proxy) Minions.

Using ``salt-sproxy``, you can continue to benefit from the scalability,
flexibility and extensibility of Salt, while you don't have to manage thousands
of (Proxy) Minion services. However, you are able to use both ``salt-sproxy`` 
and your (Proxy) Minions at the same time.

Why ``salt-sproxy``
-------------------

``salt-sproxy`` can be used as a standalone tool to manage your devices without
having any further requirements, as well as an extension to your existing Salt
environment (if you already have). In other words, if you have a Salt
installation where you manage some network devices and servers, installing
``salt-sproxy`` on your Master will allow you to run any Salt command as always,
e.g., executing ``salt \* test.ping`` and ``salt-sproxy \* test.ping`` will have
the exact same effect, and result. On top of that, using ``salt-sproxy`` allows
you to manage other devices for which you don't run (Proxy) Minions for.

Of course, if you don't already have Salt, no problem, you can start managing
your devices straight away, check out the `quick 
start steps <https://github.com/mirceaulinic/salt-sproxy/blob/develop/docs/quick_start.rst>`__.

In brief, here are some benefits you can get by using *salt-sproxy*:

- Say goodbye to the burden of managing hundreds of system services for the
  Proxy Minion processes.
- Reuse your existing extension modules, templates, Pillars, States, etc., you
  may have already developed in your Salt environment, transparently.
- You can run it locally, on your own computer.
- You can use *salt-sproxy* to uniformly manage network devices, servers 
  (either using regular Minions, or `SSH 
  <https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ssh.html>`_), applications 
  (e.g., Docker containers, VMWare ESXi clusters and vCenters, Marathon or 
  Chronos clusters, etc.), and virtually anything that has a programmable 
  interface.
- Python programming made a breeze - might go well with the
  `ISalt <https://github.com/mirceaulinic/isalt>`__ package.
- Integrates easily with your existing Salt environment (if you have), by
  installing the package on your Salt Master.
- Can continue to leverage the event-driven automation and orchestration
  methodologies.
- Can continue using any of the usual `targeting mechanisms 
  <https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targeting.html>`__.
- REST API, see also
  `the Salt REST API <https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salt_api.html>`__
  documentation.
- By sending events to a Salt Master, you are able to implement whatever
  auditing you need (e.g., what command was executed by who and when, etc.).
- Benefit from inheriting _all_ the native Salt features and integrations
  contributed by thousands of users, and tested in hundreds of different
  environments, over almost a decade of development.

Is ``salt-sproxy`` a wrapper around ``salt-ssh``?
-------------------------------------------------

No, nothing to do with *salt-ssh*. The core of *salt-sproxy* is a Runner loaded
dynamically on runtime, that spins up a pool of child processes, each running
a temporary light version of the Proxy Minion underneath; as soon as the 
execution is complete for a device, its associated Proxy Minion is shut down, 
and another one takes its place into the child processes bucket.

A source of confusion may also be the usage of the `Roster 
<https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roster.html>`__ interface, which,
historically has only been used by *salt-ssh*, although the Roster is not 
tightly coupled with *salt-ssh*: it just happened to be the only use case so 
far. Essentially, the Roster simply provides a list of devices together with 
their credentials (e.g., similar to the *inventory* as dubbed in other
automation frameworks) - and now has another use case in *salt-sproxy*.

Prerequisites
-------------

The package is distributed via PyPI, under the name ``salt-sproxy``. If you 
would like to install it on your computer, you might want to run it under a
`virtual environment <https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/>`__.

Besides the CLI, the usage remains the same as when you're running a Salt 
environment with Proxy or regular Minions. For example, see the following
documents on how to get started and fully unleash the power of Salt:

- `Salt in 10 minutes 
  <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html>`__.
- `Salt fundamentals 
  <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/fundamentals/>`__.
- `Salt configuration management 
  <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/config/>`__.
- `Network Automation features available in Salt 
  <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/network_automation/index.html>`__.
- `Network Automation at Scale: up and running in 60 minutes 
  <https://ripe74.ripe.net/presentations/18-RIPE-74-Network-automation-at-scale-up-and-running-in-60-minutes.pdf>`__.
- `Network Automation at Scale (free e-book) 
  <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/network-automation-at/9781491992524/>`__.

Install
-------

Install this package where you would like to manage your devices from. In case
you need a specific Salt version, make sure you install it beforehand, 
otherwise this package will bring the latest Salt version available instead.

Execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install salt-sproxy

To install a specific Salt version, execute, e.g.,

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install salt==2018.3.4
    pip install salt-sproxy

See https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html for more 
installation details.

Documentation
-------------

The complete documentation is available at 
https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

On Unix distributions you can also check the documentation locally, by 
executing ``man salt-sproxy``.

Quick Start
-----------

See this recording for a live quick start:

.. raw:: html

  <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/247697?autoplay=1" target="_blank"><img src="static/247697.svg" /></a>

In the above, ``minion1`` is 
a `dummy  <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/proxy/all/salt.proxy.dummy.html>`__
Proxy Minion, that can be used for getting started and make the first steps 
without connecting to an actual device, but get used to the ``salt-sproxy``
methodology.

The Master configuration file is ``/home/mircea/master``, which is why the
command is executed using the ``-c`` option specifying the path to the directory
with the configuration file. In this Master configuration file, the
``pillar_roots`` option points to ``/srv/salt/pillar`` which is where 
``salt-sproxy`` is going to load the Pillar data from. Accordingly, the Pillar 
Top file is under that path, ``/srv/salt/pillar/top.sls``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  base:
    minion1:
      - dummy

This Pillar Top file says that the Minion ``minion1`` will have the Pillar data 
from the ``dummy.sls`` from the same directory, thus 
``/srv/salt/pillar/dummy.sls``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  proxy:
    proxytype: dummy

In this case, it was sufficient to only set the ``proxytype`` field to 
``dummy``.

``salt-sproxy`` can be used in conjunction with any of the available `Salt 
Proxy modules <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/proxy/all/index.html>`__,
or others that you might have in your own environment. See 
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/proxyminion/index.html to 
understand how to write a new Proxy module if you require.

For example, let's take a look at how we can manage a network device through 
the `NAPALM Proxy <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/proxy/all/salt.proxy.napalm.html>`__:

.. raw:: html

  <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/247726?autoplay=1" target="_blank"><img src="static/247726.svg" /></a>

In the same Python virtual environment as previously, make sure  you have
``NAPALM`` installed, by executing ``pip install napalm`` (see
https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html for further 
installation requirements, depending on the platform you're running on). The 
connection credentials for the ``juniper-router`` are stored in the 
``/srv/salt/pillar/junos.sls`` Pillar, and we can go ahead and start executing
arbitrary Salt commands, e.g., `net.arp 
<https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.napalm_network.html#salt.modules.napalm_network.arp>`__ 
to retrieve the ARP table, or `net.load_config 
<https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.napalm_network.html#salt.modules.napalm_network.load_config>`__ 
to apply a configuration change on the router.

The Pillar Top file in this example was (under the same path as previously, as 
the Master config was the same):

.. code-block:: yaml

  base:
    juniper-router:
      - junos

Thanks to `Tesuto <https://www.tesuto.com/>`__ for providing the virtual 
machine for the demos!

Usage
-----

First off, make sure you have the Salt `Pillar Top file 
<https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/top.html>`_ is correctly
defined and the ``proxy`` key is available into the Pillar. For more in-depth 
explanation and examples, check `this 
<https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/proxyminion/index.html>`__ tutorial 
from the official SaltStack docs.

Once you have that, you can start using ``salt-sproxy`` even without any Proxy
Minions or Salt Master running. To check, can start by executing:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ salt-sproxy -L a,b,c --preview-target
    - a
    - b
    - c

The syntax is very similar to the widely used CLI command ``salt``, however the
way it works is completely different under the hood:

``salt-sproxy <target> <function> [<arguments>]``

Usage Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ salt-sproxy cr1.thn.lon test.ping
    cr1.thn.lon:
        True

You can continue reading further details at 
https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, for now, check out the following 
section to see how to get started with ``salt-sproxy`` straight away.

See also https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html for 
more usage examples.

Event-Driven Automation and Orchestration
-----------------------------------------

It is still possible to use the salt-sproxy functionality in the event-driven
context, even without running Proxy or regular Minions. To see how to achieve 
this, see this section of the documentation: 
https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/events.html.

Using the Salt REST API
-----------------------

Salt has natively available an HTTP API. You can read more at 
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#a-rest-api-for-salt 
if you haven't used it before. The usage is very simple; for salt-sproxy 
specifically you can follow the notes from 
https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salt_sapi.html how to set it up and 
use. Usage example - apply a small configuration change on a Juniper device, by 
executing an HTTP request via the Salt API:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ curl -sS localhost:8080/run -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' \
    -d eauth='pam' \
    -d username='mircea' \
    -d password='pass' \
    -d client='sproxy' \
    -d tgt='juniper-router' \
    -d fun='net.load_config' \
    -d text='set system ntp server 10.10.10.1'
  return:
  - juniper-router:
      already_configured: false
      comment: ''
      diff: '[edit system]
        +   ntp {
        +       server 10.10.10.1;
        +   }'
      loaded_config: ''
      result: true

See the `documentation 
<https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salt_sapi.html>`__ for explanation,
and `this example <https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/salt_sapi.html>`__
for a quick start.
