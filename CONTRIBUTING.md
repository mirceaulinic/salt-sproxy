## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the
   layer when doing a build.
2. Update the documentation, and - if necessary - also the README.rst with
   details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables,
   exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.rst to the
   new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we
   use is the same used by
   [Salt](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/releases/version_numbers.html)
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one
   reviewer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may ask one
   maintainer to merge it for you.
